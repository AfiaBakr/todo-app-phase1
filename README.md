* Hackathon II
** The Evolution of Todo – Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud Native AI

The future of software development is AI-native and spec-driven. As AI agents like Claude Code become more powerful, the role of the engineer shifts from "syntax writer" to "system architect." We have already explored Spec-Driven Book Authoring. Now, we want you to master the Architecture of Intelligence.

* Project Details: The Evolution of Todo

** Focus and Theme: 
    From CLI to Distributed Cloud-Native AI Systems.
** Goal: 
    Students act as Product Architects, using AI to build progressively complex software without writing boilerplate code.

** Project Overview
This project simulates the real-world evolution of software. You will start with a simple script and end with a Kubernetes-managed, event-driven, AI-powered distributed system.

*** Phase Breakdown

** Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App - Basic Level Functionality

*** Objective: Build a command-line todo application that stores tasks in memory using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

*** Requirements
    • Implement all 5 Basic Level features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete)
    • Use spec-driven development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus
    • Follow clean code principles and proper Python project structure

*** Technology Stack
    • UV
    • Python 3.13+
    • Claude Code
    • Spec-Kit Plus

*** Deliverables
    1. GitHub repository with:
        • Constitution file
        • specs history folder containing all specification files
        • /src folder with Python source code
        • README.md with setup instructions
        • CLAUDE.md with Claude Code instructions
    2. Working console application demonstrating:
        • Adding tasks with title and description
        • Listing all tasks with status indicators
        • Updating task details
        • Deleting tasks by ID
        • Marking tasks as complete/incomplete
